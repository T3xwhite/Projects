# Tex White Public Projects

## K-Coloring and Graph-Isomorphism

This project uses object oriented programming in python in order to allow a user to draw graphs and automatically compute vertex colorings and graph isomorphisms. For more information, visit the full project at https://github.com/T3xwhite/KColoring

## Snake Project

This project uses object oriented programming in python in order to build a Snake game which can be played by humans or by various algorithms I have implemented. For more information, visit the full project at https://github.com/T3xwhite/SnakeProject

## Magnetic-Shielding Project

This project uses python in Jupyter Notebooks with the Matplotlib and Numpy libraries in order to:

* simulate magnetic fields in cylinder and box magnets in order to determine the magnetic shielding properties of current-carrying wires
* create visualizations of H and B-fields in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of conductor symmetry and wire count on magnetic shielding processes

This project was done in collaboration with a classmate, Veronica Alfaro and submitted as our final project for Physics 260: Honors Physics at the University of Michigan. For the full project, visit https://github.com/T3xwhite/MagnetProject
